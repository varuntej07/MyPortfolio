                Hello again! I'm Varun Tej. I'm currently pursuing my masters in CS at Seattle University
                As a graduate student at Seattle University,
                I am passionate about leveraging cutting-edge technologies to solve complex problems and create impactful solutions.
                My journey in computer science is driven by a commitment to innovation and continuous learning.

                I have hands-on experience in full stack development, having created a comprehensive address management application.
                This project sharpened my skills in React.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB, enabling me to design robust APIs and optimize performance.
                I have also explored mobile app development, significantly contributing to the Pawfect Match App, a Flutter-based project connecting dog owners.
                This enhanced my proficiency in Flutter and Dart, emphasizing user-centric design and data management.

                With a strong foundation in theoretical knowledge and practical application, I am eager to push the boundaries of technology.
                I am open to opportunities in software development and engineering, where I can apply my skills and passion to drive innovation and deliver exceptional results.
